## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the models proposed and evaluated in the article "Interaction-aware Maneuver Intention Prediction using Gated Mixture-of-Experts Attention Mechanism". 


## Abstract

Predicting the behavior of traffic participants is a perceptual task that involves many challenges, such as modeling road geometry and the complex interaction of agents. In this sense, multi-modal perception takes advantage of different information modalities to improve the performance of perception tasks through the combination of features. This paper proposes an Attention-based Interaction-aware Maneuver Prediction framework, called AIMP, using interaction graphs to extract complex interaction features from traffic scenes.  
In addition, we propose a Gated Mixture-of-Experts Attention Mechanism to fuse information from road geometry, interaction, and motion dynamics, considering prior estimation of the maneuver's intentions, which gives more explainability and informativeness to the fusion process. Experimental results show relevant improvement (2% ~ 9% of accuracy) in the proposed model when compared with other fusion operations.
